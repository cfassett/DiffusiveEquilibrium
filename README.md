# DiffusiveEquilibrium

This repository has the code used in the draft paper "Topographic Diffusion Revisited: Small Crater Lifetime on the Moon and Implications for Volatile Exploration".  This corrects a few bugs in the previous repo version.

The code subdirectory has python code for making a specific figure in the paper (shown in the "result"  directory;  some labeling in Adobe Illustrator later added to the version in the manuscript). It's very much spaghetti code, apologies for that.  Typical python libraries are required; the only non-standard library is pynverse https://pypi.org/project/pynverse/, used to numerically invert the Neukum chronology function.
