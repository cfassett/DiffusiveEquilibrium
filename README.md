# DiffusiveEquilibrium

This repository has the code used in the draft paper "Topographic Diffusion Revisited: Small Crater Lifetime on the Moon".

Each subdirectory has the code for making a specific figure in the paper.  It's kind of spaghetti code, apologies for that.  Typical python libraries are required; the only non-standard library is pynverse https://pypi.org/project/pynverse/, used to numerically invert the Neukum chronology function.
